# enas
## Inspiration
Racism in the society is a major issue which most of the people from some community face everyday. I had an idea in my mind that helps people to prevent being bullied from racists.

## What it does
Enas is based on to prevent racism faced by black community. If someone faces bully due to racism, user can click on a button to send a report to Police department, enas community volunteers and enas users nearby, including the victim's live location so that victim could be helped instantly! Another feature is to signup as a volunteer to help people being bullied due to racism nearby.

## How we built it
-We used figma to design basic user interface based on dark theme to show **Respect towards Black Community!**
-Used Google cloud services in the map used for live location detection feature in the app.
-Android Studio to deploy the app

## Challenges we ran into
We had a busy schedule this weekend but anyhow, we managed to complete the project by dividing the work load amongst 3 of us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully designed Android app UI and Deployed the app

## What we learned
-Got to learn about android app development
-Learned integration of google cloud to the project

## What's next for Enas
-We will try to improve the software
-Introduce Enas to all platforms available to target a large audience.
-Planning to make a hardware device with a button that sends quick SOS message
-Prepare a Machine Learning model that automatically detects what problem the user is facing when button is pressed, and sends the SOS message describing the current situation, **INCLUDING AUDIO RECORDING OF ARGUMENTS**
